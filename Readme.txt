AP_brws_dist_all.csv
Tracks for transects 1, 2, 3, 119 and 211 are missing, so no transect lengtsh are available for Distance analysis. Therefore, data from these transects has been removed. AP_brws_dist_all.csv contains all confirmed AP burrows recorded along the remaining transects.

All_detections_wpts.csv
Modified version of Transects.xls. All transects with no detections removed.

Clean_detections_wpts.csv
Removed extraneous columns, removed detections along transects for which tracks are missing (2,3,7,63,119).

Tr-clip_by_strata_singpart.shp
Sections of transects that lie outside the DEM were removed i.e. they did not have ufcm values assigned for stratum during the link exercise in QGIS.

Clean_detecs_join_tr_secs.shp
Clean detections joined to transect sections from exploded transects (Tr-clip_by_strata_singpart.shp)
